Asynchronous testing support could be better in Jasmine. Chai didn't work in IE8 out of the box. expect.js has unfixed bugs and the syntax isn't as fluent as Jasmine's.\r\n\r\n### The MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\n> Copyright (C) 2013 Mikael Blomberg.\r\n>\r\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\r\n> obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files\r\n> (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction,\r\n> including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge,\r\n> publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software,\r\n> and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\r\n> subject to the following conditions:\r\n>\r\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\n> included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n>\r\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\n> EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\n> MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\n> NONINFRINGEMENT.
