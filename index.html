<p>ExpectJS is a Behavior Driven Development assertion library for JavaScript.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The main purpose of ExpectJS is to make your BDD test writing easy to read, write and maintain.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>When should I use ExpectJS</h2>

<ul>
<li>You want to write fluent tests</li>
<li>You want to use an assertion library for the test framework of your choice</li>
<li>You want to use the same assertion library in all environments</li>
<li>You want to extend the assertion library easily</li>
</ul><h2>Why did you create this?</h2>

<p>Jasmine, Chai and expect.js are great, but they all have something that didn't quite work as well as it could. Asynchronous testing support could be better in Jasmine. Chai didn't work in IE8 out of the box. expect.js has unfixed bugs and the syntax isn't as fluent as Jasmine's.</p>
